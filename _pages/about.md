<p>Hi! I'm a research fellow at CERN, the European Laboratory for Nuclear Research. I'm a member of the CERN ATLAS Team, and am presently a convener of the ATLAS Jet/EtMiss Combined Performance Group.</p>

<p>The strong force is everywhere at the LHC, and understanding it better means that we can learn more about the Standard Model and what lies beyond from the LHC data. My research focuses on making precision measurements of hadronic 'jets' of particles and their internal 'substructure.' These measurements are compared to cutting-edge theoretical calculations, and used as reference datasets in the development of Monte Carlo simulations and Parton Shower algorithms used everywhere in collider physics.</p>

<p>I've searched for new particles in the ATLAS data. I have been a subgroup convener in the ATLAS Jet/EtMiss and Standard Model groups. I have coordinated the preparation of <i>in situ</i> jet calibrations for small- and large-radius jets used by ATLAS in hundreds of Run 2 physics analyses, and I have developed new jet reconstruction algorithms to improve jet substructure performance in ATLAS for Run 3 of the LHC. I've also spent time characterising prototype monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) for use at future experiments.</p>

<p>If you're interested in collaborating, chatting, or starting a new ATLAS measurement using jets or photons, please don't hesitate to contact me using the links at the bottom of this page!</p>
