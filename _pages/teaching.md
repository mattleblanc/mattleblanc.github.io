This page contains resources for aspiring physicists, particularly for those who are interested in working as research assistants for the first time. To be a productive particle physics researcher, there are a number of skills you should try to learn that go beyond your knowledge of physics itself.

# Computing and software

* Working from the command line interface
    * <a href="https://www.unixtutorial.org/basic-unix-commands">Basic Unix commands</a> from unixtutorial.org
    * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOzYXKsW53A">Linux terminal introduction</a>
* Command-line text editors:
    * emacs
        * <a href="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/">Absolute beginner's guide (GUI)</a>
    * vi / vim
        * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_DvfdgR-LA">'Basics of vi in under 8 minutes' (video)</a>
        * <a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">vim adventures (learn vim by playing a game!)</a>
* git
* Parallel / batch computing: condor, slurm

# Communicating results

* It's helpful to understand the best ways to communicate using data. This can be different, depending on the dataset and what aspects of it you're hoping to convey.  A good starting place for this is the classic: [E. Tufte, 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) _-- I have a copy in my office you can borrow._

* An interesting article about planning and giving mathematics lectures, containing good lessons also for certain kinds of conference talks, seminars, etc.: [P. R. Halmos, _How to talk Mathematics_](https://web.archive.org/web/20150409210822/https://www.math.northwestern.edu/graduate/Forum/HALMOS.html).
